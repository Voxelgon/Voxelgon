UnitySQL

A SQLite library for Unity3D

Several libraries for SQL exist for the .NET framework, however many rely on namespaces or packages not easily added to
Unity3D. This library is developed primarily for Voxelgon, however I have decided to make it its own repo to help other
developers hoping to use a SQLite database.

The library uses the Mono.Sqlite package, included in the repository. The package is designed for use with the Unity 
game engine, but I plan to allow it to function in other .NET applications.
